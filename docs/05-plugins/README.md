# Plugins

There are a number of different plugins you can use to both compile and edit the Schema setup.
This could be used for compiling a schema from a database model (currently only supports mongoose) to Relay, connections and more.

## List of plugins

- [graphql-compose-mongoose](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose-mongoose) - right now the most powerful mongoose schema converter to graphql types
- [graphql-compose-relay](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose-relay) - get TypeComposer(GraphQLType + Resolvers) and apply some wrappers to make them Relay compliant.
- [graphql-compose-connection](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose-connection) - extended realization of `GraphQL Cursor Connections`, introduced `filter` and `sort` arguments.
